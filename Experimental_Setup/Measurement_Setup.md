## Experimental Measurement Setup

Electrical characterization of HfO₂-based MOS capacitors was carried out using standard
capacitance–voltage (C–V) and current–voltage (I–V) measurement techniques. The objective
was to extract key electrical parameters and identify dominant conduction mechanisms in
the dielectric.

### 1. MOS Capacitor Structure

The fabricated MOS capacitor structure consists of:

- Metal gate (Pt)
- High-k dielectric layer (HfO₂)
- p-type silicon substrate

The structure can be represented as:

Metal / HfO₂ / p-Si

### 4. Data Analysis Approach

Measured C–V and I–V data were analyzed using standard MOS theory and tunneling models.
The experimental results were fitted to Fowler–Nordheim and Poole–Frenkel models to
identify dominant conduction mechanisms under different electric field conditions.
