# Electrical Characterization of RF-Sputtered HfO₂ MOS Capacitors

This repository contains the M.Sc. (Electronics Science) final-year project work focused on the
electrical characterization and tunneling mechanism analysis of RF-sputtered HfO₂-based
MOS capacitors.

## 📌 Project Overview
As CMOS devices scale down, conventional SiO₂ gate dielectrics suffer from excessive
leakage current due to quantum mechanical tunneling. High-k dielectrics such as HfO₂
offer improved capacitance control while reducing equivalent oxide thickness (EOT).

This project investigates the effect of RF sputtering time and post-deposition annealing
temperature on the electrical behavior and tunneling mechanisms of HfO₂ MOS capacitors.

## 🔬 Key Objectives
- Fabrication of HfO₂ thin films using RF magnetron sputtering
- Electrical characterization using C–V and I–V measurements
- Identification of dominant tunneling mechanisms (FN, PF, Schottky)
- Analysis of interface states, oxide charge density, and leakage current behavior

## 🧪 Experimental Details
- Substrate: p-type Si ⟨100⟩
- Deposition: RF magnetron sputtering
- Sputtering time: 5 min, 10 min, 20 min
- Annealing: 500 °C and 600 °C (RTA in O₂)
- Contacts: Pt/HfO₂/p-Si MOS structure

## 📊 Characterization Techniques
- Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (Thickness analysis)
- C–V and G–V Measurements (Keysight LCR Meter)
- I–V Measurements (Keithley Source Meter)
- Fowler–Nordheim and Poole–Frenkel fitting

## 📈 Key Findings
- Film thickness increases with sputtering time
- Annealing reduces interface trap density and oxide charge
- Poole–Frenkel emission dominates at low electric fields
- Fowler–Nordheim tunneling dominates at high electric fields
