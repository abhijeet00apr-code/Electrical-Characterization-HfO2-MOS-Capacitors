## Results Summary

This section summarizes the key experimental observations obtained from the electrical
characterization of RF-sputtered HfO₂ MOS capacitors using C–V and I–V measurements.

### 1. Ellipsometry Analysis

- Film thickness increased with increasing RF sputtering time
- Post-deposition annealing resulted in a slight reduction in film thickness
- Higher annealing temperatures led to improved film densification

These results confirm controlled deposition of HfO₂ thin films.

### 2. Capacitance–Voltage (C–V) Characteristics

- Clear accumulation, depletion, and inversion regions were observed
- Annealed samples showed reduced hysteresis compared to as-deposited samples
- Flat-band voltage shift decreased after annealing
- Interface trap density reduced with increasing annealing temperature

C–V results indicate improved dielectric–silicon interface quality after annealing.

### 3. Current–Voltage (I–V) Characteristics

- Leakage current increased with applied electric field
- Annealed samples exhibited modified leakage behavior compared to as-deposited films
- Leakage current trends were strongly influenced by sputtering time and annealing

I–V analysis provides insight into dielectric reliability and conduction behavior.

### 4. Conduction Mechanism Analysis

- At low electric fields, Poole–Frenkel emission dominated the leakage current
- At high electric fields, Fowler–Nordheim tunneling became dominant
- Linear fitting of PF and FN plots confirmed the respective conduction mechanisms

The transition from PF to FN conduction reflects the combined influence of trap states and
electric field strength in HfO₂ films.

### 5. Overall Observations

- RF sputtering time controls film thickness and electrical properties
- Post-deposition annealing improves interface quality and electrical stability
- HfO₂ demonstrates strong potential as a high-k gate dielectric for MOS applications

These results validate the suitability of RF-sputtered HfO₂ for advanced MOS device
applications when optimized fabrication conditions are employed.
