## Fowler–Nordheim and Poole–Frenkel Analysis

To identify the dominant conduction mechanisms in HfO₂-based MOS capacitors, experimental
I–V data were analyzed using Fowler–Nordheim (FN) tunneling and Poole–Frenkel (PF) emission
models.

### 1. Poole–Frenkel (PF) Emission Analysis

At low to moderate electric fields, leakage current was analyzed using the Poole–Frenkel
model.

**Analysis method:**
- Plot: ln(J/E) versus √E
- Linear behavior indicates PF emission

**Physical interpretation:**
- Conduction occurs through trap-assisted thermal emission
- Electric field lowers the trap barrier height
- Indicates presence of bulk traps in HfO₂

PF emission dominance suggests defect-related conduction in the dielectric.

### 2. Fowler–Nordheim (FN) Tunneling Analysis

At higher electric fields, Fowler–Nordheim tunneling becomes significant.

**Analysis method:**
- Plot: ln(J/E²) versus 1/E
- Linear behavior confirms FN tunneling

**Physical interpretation:**
- Electrons tunnel through a triangular potential barrier
- Strong field-driven conduction
- Indicates relatively good dielectric integrity

FN tunneling dominance at high fields reflects improved dielectric quality.

### 3. Transition Between PF and FN Mechanisms

The transition from PF emission at low fields to FN tunneling at high fields provides
valuable insight into the electrical behavior of the dielectric.

- PF region: Trap-assisted conduction
- FN region: Field-driven tunneling

This transition confirms the combined influence of defects and electric field strength
on leakage current behavior in HfO₂ MOS capacitors.

FN and PF analysis helps in:
- Understanding leakage current mechanisms
- Evaluating dielectric quality
- Assessing suitability of HfO₂ for MOS applications
- Correlating fabrication and annealing effects with electrical performance
