## RF Sputtering and Post-Deposition Annealing

The fabrication of HfO₂ thin films plays a critical role in determining the electrical
performance of MOS capacitors. In this project, RF magnetron sputtering was employed to
deposit HfO₂ films, followed by post-deposition annealing to improve film quality.

### 1. Substrate Preparation

- p-type silicon ⟨100⟩ substrates were used
- Substrates were cleaned using standard chemical cleaning procedures
- Native oxide and surface contaminants were removed prior to deposition

Proper substrate preparation is essential to achieve a high-quality dielectric–silicon
interface.

### 2. RF Magnetron Sputtering of HfO₂

HfO₂ thin films were deposited using RF magnetron sputtering.

**Deposition details:**
- Target material: HfO₂
- Deposition technique: RF sputtering
- Sputtering times: Multiple durations (e.g., 5 min, 10 min, 20 min)
- Purpose: Control film thickness and dielectric properties

Increasing sputtering time results in increased film thickness, which directly affects
capacitance and leakage current behavior.

### 3. Post-Deposition Annealing

Post-deposition annealing was performed to enhance the electrical properties of the HfO₂
films.

**Annealing conditions:**
- Annealing temperatures: 500 °C and 600 °C
- Ambient: Oxygen
- Technique: Rapid thermal annealing (RTA)

**Benefits of annealing:**
- Reduction in interface trap density
- Improved film densification
- Decrease in oxide charge density
- Enhanced electrical stability

Annealing plays a crucial role in optimizing C–V characteristics and reducing leakage
current.
