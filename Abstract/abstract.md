## Abstract

As CMOS technology continues to scale down, conventional SiO₂ gate dielectrics face
significant limitations due to excessive leakage current caused by quantum mechanical
tunneling. High-k dielectric materials such as hafnium dioxide (HfO₂) have emerged as
promising alternatives due to their ability to provide higher gate capacitance while
maintaining reduced leakage current and improved device reliability.

In this work, HfO₂ thin films were deposited on p-type silicon substrates using RF
magnetron sputtering. The influence of sputtering time and post-deposition annealing
temperature on the electrical properties of HfO₂-based MOS capacitors was systematically
investigated. Electrical characterization was performed using capacitance–voltage (C–V)
and current–voltage (I–V) measurements.

C–V analysis was used to extract key parameters such as oxide capacitance, flat-band
voltage, oxide charge density, and interface trap density. I–V measurements were carried
out to study leakage current behavior under different electric field conditions. The
dominant conduction mechanisms were identified by fitting the experimental data to
standard tunneling models.

The results indicate that post-deposition annealing improves film quality by reducing
interface trap density and oxide charges. At low electric fields, Poole–Frenkel emission
was observed to be the dominant conduction mechanism, while Fowler–Nordheim tunneling
became significant at higher electric fields. These findings demonstrate the suitability
of RF-sputtered HfO₂ as a high-k gate dielectric material for advanced MOS device
applications.
